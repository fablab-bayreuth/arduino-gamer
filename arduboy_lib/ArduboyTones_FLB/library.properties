sentence=Modified ArdubyTones library. A library for playing a sequence of tones, intended for use with the Arduboy game system. Supports the Fablab Bayreuth Arduino Gamer hardware.
paragraph=Plays one or more tones in sequence. Driven by interrupts, so audio plays in the background while the "real" program runs in the foreground. Written to minimize code size by specifically targeting the processor and pins of the Arduboy.
