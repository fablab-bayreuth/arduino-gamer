# arduino-gamer/space-invaders

Space invaders game sketch. Forked from tardate's [ArdWinVaders](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/playground/OLED/ArdWinVaders)
game and adapted to the arduino-gamer hardware.

This game brings its own graphics drive for SSD1306 based display and only depends on the Arduino standard library.
